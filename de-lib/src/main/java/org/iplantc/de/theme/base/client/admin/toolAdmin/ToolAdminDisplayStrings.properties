#Warnings
toolEntryPointWarning = <br><p><b>WARNING:</b>  Do not add a tool without an Entry Point setting if its Docker image also does not have a default `ENTRYPOINT`. If a tool like this is required, then its Network Mode setting should be set to `none` to contain any risky scripts run by this tool.</p><br>
toolVolumeWarning = <br><p><b>WARNING:</b>  Do not add Container Volumes or Container Volumes From settings to tools unless it is certain that tool is authorized to access that data.</p><br>
